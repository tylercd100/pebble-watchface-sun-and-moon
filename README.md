# pebble-watchface-sun-and-moon
A watchface for pebble time and pebble round that depicts the sun and the moon's position in the sky.

In order to calculate the Sun/Moon rise and set times location services will need to be enabled.

- At 0 degrees (left side of the watchface) the Sun/Moon is rising over the horizon.
- At 180 degrees (right side of the watchface) the Sun/Moon object is setting under the horizon.
- When the Sun/Moon is below the earth then it is below your horizon.
